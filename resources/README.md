# Resources

This directory contains instructions and resources that help deploy and run banana. Currently, we have provided:

1. Directions for enabling cross-origin resource-sharing (CORS) in Solr, in the _enable-cors_ directory.
2. solrconfig.xml and schema.xml for the bananaconfig collection that is used for storing internal details such as dashboards. The _bananaconfig-solr-5.0_ directory works with Solr 5, while _bananaconfig-solr-4.5_ works with Solr 4.5 and above.
